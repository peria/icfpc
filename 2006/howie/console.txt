Subject: Adventure game

I'm glad you enjoyed the adventure game. Yes, I am hard at work on the sequel, but I haven't gotten very far. There isn't much story yet, but I do have several of the puzzles done. You're more than welcome to try them if you like; you can add to your score that way.  To play the sequel, just run adventure with the "sequent sequel" option.


There seems to be nothing left to do here
